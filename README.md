# üïµÔ∏è Detective Case Management System

## üïµÔ∏è Project Overview

This project is a **custom API-powered detective case management system** that enables users (detectives) to seamlessly create, read, update, and delete information related to **cases**, **clues**, and **suspects**. It combines a lightweight, responsive frontend with a powerful Flask backend, allowing for smooth interaction and real-time updates.

Whether it's a high-profile bank robbery or a mysterious disappearance, detectives can use this tool to:

-  Organize multiple investigation cases  
-  Collect and track important clues  
- Maintain lists of potential suspects  

---

## üîß Technical Highlights

- **Backend**: Built using **Flask** and connected to a **MongoDB** database to store structured investigation data.
- **Frontend**: Clean and intuitive UI using plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** ‚Äî no complex frameworks.
- **API Design**: Fully custom RESTful API supporting all CRUD operations:
  - Create, retrieve, update, and delete **cases**
  - Add and list **clues** tied to specific cases
  - Add and list **suspects** associated with each case
- **API Testing**: Endpoints can be tested using tools like `curl`, Postman, or your browser.

---

## üéØ Learning Outcomes:

- Understanding **REST API** development from scratch
- Practicing **CRUD operations** with a NoSQL database
- Integrating backend APIs with a **dynamic frontend**
- Building modular, maintainable code with clear separation of concerns

## üåê Real-World Use Case

Imagine you're a detective managing dozens of open cases ‚Äî each with unique clues, suspects, and evolving descriptions. This app provides a simple, digital evidence board you can use to log discoveries, track leads, and focus your investigation.


## üìå Features

-  Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) for:
- Cases
- Clues (linked to cases)
- Suspects (linked to cases)
-  Powered by Flask + MongoDB backend
- RESTful API endpoints for integration

## How to Run the Project Locally

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sabith-code/detective-api-project.git
cd detective-api-project
```
### Step 2: Create & Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Then activate:
## Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
### macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 4: Set Up MongoDB
Make sure MongoDB is running locally or use MongoDB Atlas.

Create a .env file in the root folder:
```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017
```
### Step 5: Run the Flask Server
```bash
python app.py
```
### Step 6: Open the Frontend
```bash
static/index.html
```

| POST   | /clues           | Add new clue to a case  |

# Example: Add a Clue
```json
{
  "case_id": "REPLACE_WITH_CASE_ID",
  "detail": "Security footage at 2:00 AM"
}
```

###  Suspects endpoints
| Method | Endpoint           | Description                |
|--------|--------------------|----------------------------|
| GET    | /suspects/:case_id | Get all suspects for case  |
| POST   | /suspects          | Add new suspect to a case  |

##   Testing API with curl

## Create a Case

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/cases \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Bank Heist", "description": "Vault cracked at midnight"}'
```
## Get All Cases
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/cases
```

## Add a Clue
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/clues \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"case_id": "your_case_id", "detail": "Crowbar found at scene"}'
```
## Add a Suspect
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/suspects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

```
## Delete a Case
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/cases/your_case_id
```
## .gitignore
